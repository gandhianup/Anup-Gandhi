7.  **Introduction**

    1.  **Purpose:** This test plan describes the testing approach and overall
        framework that will drive the testing of the Monify mobile application.
        This document includes:

        1.  Test Strategy: rules the test will be based on, including the givens
            of the project (e.g.: start / end dates, objectives, assumptions);
            description of the process to set up a valid test (e.g.: entry /
            exit criteria, creation of test cases, specific tasks to perform,
            scheduling, data strategy).

        2.  Execution Strategy: How the test execution will be handled and the
            defect management tools to be used.

        3.  Test Management: process to handle the tests and all the events that
            we encounter during the execution like escalations and risks and
            mitigation plans

    2.  **Overview:** Monify app helps an individual to document every day
